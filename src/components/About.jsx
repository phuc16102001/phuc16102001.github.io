          A backend engineer with 3 YoE in software engineer field.
          I am goal-oriented, dedicated to my work, and always
          open to new experiences, especially those related to my
          field of study, to enhance my coding practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have gained many from being a leader of group projects, which is
          why problem-solving, presentation and leadership skills are not
          weaknesses of mine. I have a strong passion for software engineering
          and computer science, and I hope I can contribute to the development
          of society.
